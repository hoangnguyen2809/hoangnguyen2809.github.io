# Overview

The Sakura Room on TryHackMe is an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) challenge created by OSINT Dojo. The goal was to track down a fictional attacker by analyzing publicly available data across multiple platforms. Throughout the challenge, I used real-world OSINT methodologies to uncover a digital trail left behind.

## Tools Used

- Metadata analysis (ExifTool)

- Cross-platform username tracking

- PGP key extraction (via Kleopatra)

- Blockchain tracing (Ethereum & Tether)

- Tor network navigation (.onion URLs)

- Wi-Fi geolocation (Wigle.net)

- Visual geolocation (reverse image search)

## Finding

- Alias: SakuraSnowAngelAiko

- Real Name: Aiko Abe

- Email: SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com

- Wallet: 0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef

- Home Location: Hirosaki, Japan

- Travel Path: Washington D.C. (DCA) → Tokyo Haneda (HND) → Hirosaki

## Key Takeaways

This challenge refined my ability to collect, correlate, and analyze open-source data across multiple platforms. It reinforced the importance of metadata, historical data, and alternative platforms (e.g., Tor) in cyber investigations.
