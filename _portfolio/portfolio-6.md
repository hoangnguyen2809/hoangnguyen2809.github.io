## Overview

This project involves the creation of a virtualized penetration testing environment for hands-on cybersecurity research and offensive security training. The lab consists of three core virtual machines hosted on two systems:

- Kali Linux (attacker system)

- Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable Linux target)

- Windows 7 (legacy Windows target)

## Tools

- Nmap – for network and service discovery

- Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) – to run targeted vulnerability checks

- Nessus – for in-depth vulnerability scanning and reporting

- Metasploit Framework – for exploiting identified vulnerabilities and post-exploitation

## Key Takeaways

- Developed hands-on proficiency in the penetration testing kill chain: reconnaissance → scanning → exploitation

- Practiced using industry-standard tools to simulate real-world attack scenarios in a safe environment

- Gained insight into system misconfigurations and exploitable weaknesses in outdated OS platforms
