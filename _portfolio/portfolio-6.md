# Overview

Conducted a vulnerability assessment on a database server of a e-commerce company. The assessment follows the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines, providing a detailed analysis of potential risks, threat sources, and recommended security controls. It highlights my ability to evaluate and mitigate risks within the scope of information systems security.

## Objective

- Ensure the continued security and functionality of a critical database server by safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.
- A security breach or unavailability of the server would negatively impact critical business functions, causing potential financial loss and reputational damage. The analysis aims to identify vulnerabilities that could compromise the server and recommend measures to protect it.

## Steps

- Reviewing the System Description to understand the architecture, components, and dependencies that comprise the server's attack surface. The Scope was defined to focus on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on the server, excluding physical security or peripheral systems.

- Using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource to identify potential threats by analyzing possible threat sources and threat events

- Calculating the risk of potential threats by evaluate the frequency of the threat and the potential impact on business operations

- Proposing security recommendations to help the organization make informed decision about resource allocation, project planning, and other aspects of their business operations.

## Outcomes

The vulnerability assessment identified key risks to the business and provided actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks. Implementing the proposed strategies significantly improved the security of the database server, ensuring that sensitive data remained protected and business operations were not disrupted by potential attacks.
