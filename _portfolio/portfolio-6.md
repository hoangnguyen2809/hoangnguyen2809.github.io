## Overview

This project involves the creation of a virtualized penetration testing environment for hands-on cybersecurity research and offensive security training. The lab consists of three core virtual machines hosted on two systems:

- Kali Linux (attacker system)

- Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable Linux target)

- Windows 7 (legacy Windows target)

## Tools

- Network, service discovery with Nmap
- Vulnerability detection using targeted NSE scripts
- Vulnerability scanner Nessus
- Documentation and analysis of attack paths and mitigation strategies

## Key Takeaways

Gained practical experience in reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation using industry-standard tools like Nmap, Metasploit. Learned to identify and assess vulnerable services (e.g., SMB, FTP, HTTP) on target machines through version scanning and targeted Nmap scripts.
