# Overview

During a cybersecurity portfolio exercise, I documented an incident response for a ransomware attack targeting a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The clinic experienced severe disruption when a phishing attack led to the encryption of critical medical files, shutting down business operations.

## Objective

- Analyzed the details of the scenario

- Documented the incident timeline and key details in the incident handler's journal

- Addressing each of the 5 W's of the scenario:

  - Who caused the incident?

  - What happened?

  - When did the incident occur?

  - Where did the incident happen?

  - Why did the incident happen?

## Outcomes

Through this exercise, I gained practical experience in handling a cybersecurity incident, reinforcing my ability to respond to ransomware threats and document incidents effectively. This project strengthened my understanding of phishing attack vectors and ransomware mitigation strategies.
