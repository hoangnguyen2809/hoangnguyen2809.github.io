Hey there!

I'm Hoang, a 4th year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University. Right now, I'm diving into Cybersecurity, learning all about keeping digital stuff safe. I am also interested in Blockchain and Video game development.

You can reach me out at my email [hvn3@sfu.ca](hvn3@sfu.ca) or on discord [#noid68](https://discordapp.com/users/518071232848068608) for fastest response time.
