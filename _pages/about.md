Hi, I’m Hoang — a recent Computer Science graduate from Simon Fraser University with a strong interest in Cybersecurity. I'm actively developing my skills and looking for opportunities to grow in the field.

I am open to work. You can reach me out at my email [hvn3@sfu.ca](hvn3@sfu.ca) or on discord [#noid68](https://discordapp.com/users/518071232848068608) for fastest response time.
