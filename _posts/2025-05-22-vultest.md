# Active Reconnaissance

- Since all devices connect to the same network. Attacker machine can perform a scan to get the fingerprint of other devices.

- Kali's address is:10.0.0.91; (because I already know the address of the target, in this setting, Windows 7 address is 10.0.2.2) I only scan the subnet 10.0.0.91/24
  `nmap -sn -vv 10.0.0.91/24`

- An interesting thing is, although my phone's wifi and network cellular are off. I can still discover its appearance on the network (this is because Wi-Fi remains active in the background for features like: AirDrop, Apple services (e.g., Find My), Auto-reconnect to trusted networks)

- Get more information about the targets by finding open ports, MAC Addresses, OS,...
