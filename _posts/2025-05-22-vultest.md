Use security tools to exploit Windows 7 & Metasploitable 2

# Active Reconnaissance

- Since all devices connect to the same network. Attacker machine can perform a scan to get the fingerprint of other devices.

- Kali's address is:10.0.0.91; (because I already know the address of the target, in this setting, Windows 7 address is 10.0.2.2) I only scan the subnet 10.0.0.91/24 <br>
  &nbsp;`nmap -sn -vv 10.0.0.91/24`

  - An interesting thing is, although my phone's wifi and network cellular are off. I can still discover its appearance on the network (this is because Wi-Fi remains active in the background for features like: AirDrop, Apple services (e.g., Find My), Auto-reconnect to trusted networks)

- Getting more information about the targets by finding open ports, MAC Addresses, OS,... with nmap

- Scanning the Windows machine for known vulnerabilities using Nmap's vulnerability detection scripts:

  - Result shows that Windows 7 is vulnerable to smb-vuln-ms17-010 or remote code execution vulnerability.
    The vulnerability is actively exploited by WannaCry and Petya ransomware and other malware.

- Addition, vulnerability scanner can be used to scan all known vulnerabilites on the Windows machine:

  - Report also shows that the system is vulnerable to MS11-030: Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution with a critical severity
